The ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats poses a pervasive danger to all
facets of society, ranging from commercial enterprises to individuals and
government entities. As technology relentlessly advances and more aspects of
our lives become digitised, the risks posed by these threats continue to
escalate~\cite{ENISA}. There are numerous defence options available to help
mitigate these threats, prominent among them are \gls{nids}.

\gls{nids} are a crucial part of any information system's defence that aims to
identify and mitigate network threats in real time. Two major classifications
exist that characterise the function of intrusion detection systems.\ \gls{sids}
detect attacks by matching sequences of code or commands with those of known
attacks.\ \gls{aids} on the other hand, detect threats by recognising
deviations from normal, non-malicious traffic~\cite{survey1}.

Designing \gls{nids} suitable for the ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape is no
trivial task.\ \gls{nids} deployed practically are likely to face attacks not
known to the developer. These will be referred to as unknown attacks. These
could take the form of new deviations of known attacks, new attacks based on
known vulnerabilities or zero-day attacks, which are cyberattacks executed on
the basis of an unknown exploit. Due to their nature, \gls{sids} are
ineffective in detecting unknown attacks, as by definition, they cannot exist
on any attack signature database~\cite{survey1}.

AIDS exhibits promise through its ability to identify unknown
attacks~\cite{aids-unknown}, particularly with the advent of \gls{ml}
techniques.\ \gls{ml} techniques offer enormous potential in anomaly detection
as they have the ability to model complex patterns which may not be known to
the researcher in advance, particularly when using techniques based on
unsupervised learning, which can identify patterns without labels. Due to this
ability, researchers hope that these techniques can generalise and identify
unknown attacks.% TODO: why?, citations required

In the literature, there is no absence of works investigating the use of
\gls{ml} in \gls{nids}~\cite{Karatas, Jiang, Mighan, Pu, Cao, Zoppi, Atefinia}.
This work explores various different approaches including supervised and
unsupervised techniques. The works of~\cite{Karatas, Jiang, Mighan, Atefinia}
explore supervised techniques and demonstrate remarkable accuracies, as high as
100\%. These results offer great promise, with near perfect recall and very low
false alarm rate. Unsupervised techniques have also been researched with
results indicating a higher false alarm rate when compared to supervised
techniques~\cite{}.\ \gls{ml} techniques can also be categorised into
traditional algorithms and \gls{dl} techniques. The literature explores both
branches of \gls{ml}. Numerous studies focused on supervised techniques have
found traditional algorithms to be more effective in the field of \gls{nids}. % citation required

Some researchers have brought into question the notion that supervised
techniques can generalise to unknown attacks~\cite{Kus, Zoppi}. These studies
uncover a significant threat to many of the proposed models in the literature,
as the evaluation techniques used to measure the efficacy of the model may be
misleading. This could lead to a false sense of security that could put
information systems at serious risk to unauthorised access and misuse.

Ahmad et al.~\cite{zero-day} has noted that many studies focused on supervised
learning phrase their works as closed-set classification problems. Closed-set
classification problems have all possible classes available in the dataset,
whereas open-set classification problems may have other classes not known to
the dataset. Network intrusion detection is a dynamic field due to the constant
development of new and innovative attacks by threat actors, presenting an
open-set classification problem~\cite{}. This has been explored in the
literature, however, the number of studies exploring this aspect of the field
is far lower than the number of works proposing new closed-set models. Hence,
more research investigating the extent of generalisation and the suitability of
the proposed techniques to the problem is required.% find citation if possible% consider citation for closed set classification

Unsupervised techniques do not rely on labelled data. It can therefore be
hypothesised that they are better suited for open set classification problems
as they can detect patterns without prior knowledge of specific classes. This
is more akin to true anomaly detection whereby the algorithms focus on
detecting deviations form benign traffic as opposed to identifying specific
attacks. This notion has been explored previously in the literature by Zoppi et
al.~\cite{Zoppi}, with results supporting the hypothesis.

However, unsupervised techniques tend to have significantly higher false alarm
rates~\cite{}, which hinders their efficacy in practical applications and makes
supervised approaches more appealing. Little research exists evaluating the
supervised approaches proposed in the literature in the context of an open-set
classification problem. Furthermore, the comparitive studies found during the
literature review do not consider unsupervised deep learning
approaches~\cite{}, which may offer an alternative approach. The principal aim
of this study will be to investigate the efficacy of various techniques
proposed in the literature against both known and unknown attacks, comparing
the trade-offs between different techniques.% TODO: various? which ones?

This will take the form of two objectives:

\hypertarget{obj}{}

\begin{center}
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\linewidth}{\textbf{Objective 1:} To determine the extent to which current state-of-the-art
            network intrusion detection models are able to detect both attacks that were present and absent in their
            training set.}}
\end{center}

This information is vital to measure the pragmatic performance of these models
as \gls{nids} deployed in practical circumstances will face a wide variety of
attacks, including unknown attacks.

\begin{center}
    \fbox{\parbox{0.8\linewidth}{\textbf{Objective 2:} To investigate the extent to which unsupervised techniques are
            more or less effective against both known and unknown attacks compared to supervised
            techniques.}}
\end{center}

Unsupervised techniques do not rely on labelled attack data in their training.
Hence, they are theoretically better adapted to unknown attacks, however may be
less accurate on known attacks. This hypothesis is supported by the findings of
Zoppi et al.~\cite{Zoppi} and will be further explored in this study.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to include deep
unsupervised techniques in a comparative analysis and the first to investigate
individual attack generalisation on unsupervised techniques.
