I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my supervisors Prof.\ Mark
Micallef and Dr.\ Joseph Bugeja, without whom this project would not have been
possible. Your insightful feedback, expert guidance and unwavering
encouragement have been instrumental to this work and I am truly thankful for
your support.

I would also like to express my heartfelt appreciation to the University of
Malta for providing me with the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to carry
out this project effectively.
