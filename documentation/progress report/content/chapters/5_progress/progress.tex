\chapter{Progress so far}%
\label{chp:progress}

Most of the time invested into this project so far has been theoretical,
involving research in the background of the field, the selection of the works
to be reproduced and the formulation of a methodology to address the aims of
this project.

From a practical perspective, the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset has been downloaded
and additional labels have been added that identify unique attacks. This allows
them to be omitted when required. Additionally, a python script has been
developed to divide a dataset according to the methodology of Kus et al.\ using
these added labels.
